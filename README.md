### Concepts

#### Tracking campaigns as projects

We track each campaign in Notion, recording milestones, KPIs, and impact metrics. Status updates and historical data are available to clients, ensuring transparency and actionable insights.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img alt="Screenshot of GitHub issue" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/upptime/upptime.js.org/master/static/img/screenshot-issue.png">

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Performance tracking

Campaign response metrics and engagement data are recorded daily and visualised over time. This allows clients to see trends, optimisation opportunities, and historical performance for every campaign.
